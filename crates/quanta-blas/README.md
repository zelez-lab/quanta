# quanta-blas

Verified-numerics BLAS for Quanta. The headline claim: **the only BLAS
that ships a mechanically-proven forward-error bound for every op** —
Higham-style `(1+δ)` bounds formalised in Lean
(`specs/verify/lean/Quanta/Blas/Reference.lean`).

Cross-backend by construction (Metal / Vulkan / WebGPU / CPU), built on
`quanta-tensor` (shape proofs) and `quanta-prims` (device-resident
reductions).

## Status — Level-1 + GEMV + tiled GEMM (f32) + mixed-precision GEMM (bf16)

| op | signature | notes |
|----|-----------|-------|
| `scal` | `scal(gpu, α, &x)` | `x ← α·x`, in place |
| `axpy` | `axpy(gpu, α, &x, &y)` | `y ← α·x + y`, in place |
| `dot`  | `dot(gpu, &x, &y) -> f32` | `Σ xᵢ·yᵢ`, device-resident reduction |
| `nrm2` | `nrm2(gpu, &x) -> f32` | `√(Σ xᵢ²)` |
| `gemv` | `gemv(gpu, m, n, α, &a, &x, β, &y)` | `y ← α·A·x + β·y`, A row-major `m×n`, in place on y |
| `gemm` | `gemm(gpu, m, n, k, α, &a, &b, β, &c)` | `C ← α·A·B + β·C`, row-major, in place on C |
| `gemm_mixed` | `gemm_mixed(gpu, dtype, m, n, k, α, &a, &b, β, &c)` | mixed-precision: A,B narrow (`GemmInputType`), C f32 |
| `gemv_mixed` | `gemv_mixed(gpu, dtype, m, n, α, &a, &x, β, &y)` | mixed-precision GEMV (via `gemm_mixed` N=1) |

`scal`/`axpy` mutate in place (these ops are memory-bandwidth-bound;
avoiding a second buffer is the win). `dot`/`nrm2` multiply into a temp
field on the GPU and reduce there, so the vector never leaves the device.
`gemv` is a GEMM with one output column (`gemm(m, 1, n, …)`) — a gemv entry
*is* a gemm entry, so it reuses the gemm kernel and the same proven bound.
`gemm` uses the **tiled shared-memory** kernel (sub-tile problems route to a
naive kernel that skips the barrier overhead) — correct on every backend and
matching the proven Higham §3.5 contract.

`gemm_mixed` / `gemv_mixed` store A,B in a narrow dtype (currently **bf16**,
in a `Field<u16>` — one bf16 per 2-byte element), convert each element to f32
on load, and **accumulate in f32** — the standard ML mixed-precision path.
The output contract is the same real-arithmetic GEMM entry; the dtype is an
implementation detail of *how* the entry is computed. The forward-error bound
splits into the proven f32 GEMM error over the bf16-rounded inputs plus the
input-quantisation error (`Quanta.Blas.gemmEntryMixedBf16_error_split`), so
each dtype reuses the GEMM proof. f16 / fp8 / int8 / int4 land next.

The crate is a pure-Rust reference library (`quanta_blas::reference`, the
differential-test oracle) until you enable `gpu` + a backend:

```toml
quanta-blas = { version = "0.1", features = ["gpu-metal"] } # or gpu-vulkan
```

Coming next: the cooperative-matrix / tensor-core `gemm` path (the vendor
perf gap) and the f16/bf16/i8 dtype matrix.

## Performance (honest framing)

The tiled GEMM is a real win over the naive kernel — **3.8× at N=512** on an
M1 Pro (369 vs 97 GFLOP/s), the speedup growing with size as the shared-memory
reuse compounds. But that is still only ~7% of the M1 Pro's fp32 peak: the
generic tiled kernel closes the *easy* gap over naive, not the vendor gap. The
strategic targets (~80% of vendor BLAS on tier-2 Apple-Silicon GPUs) are
reached by the **cooperative-matrix / tensor-core path** (`simdgroup_matrix`,
`VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix`), the next GEMM increment. Level-1 ops are
bandwidth-bound — the generic kernel is already near memory roofline.

We never hide where we lose — full numbers, backend coverage, and the gaps
are in [`PERFORMANCE.md`](PERFORMANCE.md).
